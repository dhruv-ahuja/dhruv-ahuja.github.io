## Summary

Contributed to the open-source 2D graphics editor with 21K+ stars on GitHub. Implemented core node graph functionality including automatic link reconnection when deleting nodes, and added new creative tools like the Color Overlay node.
My work enhanced the user experience by fixing some commonly encountered bugs and adding adding to the available toolbox.
