## Summary

Contributed to Pydantic's Logfire observability platform. Thus far, I have worked on the core APIs and the SDK layer, and capturing documentation behaviour to improve the experience for SDK users.
My work thus far has seen me improve core model representation in the dashboard UI, improve the SDK API's accessbility, among other things.
