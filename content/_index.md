## About

Welcome to my website, my name is Dhruv and I’m a self-taught software engineer mostly interested in backend with a pinch of frontend engineering. I started programming in May of 2021 and started working professionally in July 2022. The first language that I learnt and the one that I work in primarily is Python, though I spent several months just nerding over Rust sometime back, proof of which can found in my blogs and projects. I am also exploring and practicing frontend technologies.

I am currently primarily hacking on [backend_burger](https://github.com/dhruv-ahuja/backend_burger) and learning about scalable backend concepts plus some computer science concepts as well.

I work as a software engineer at [DwellFi](https://dwell.fi), an US-based startup automating venture fund management processes and reducing manual workloads. In my free time, I am also contributing to Pydantic's [Logfire observability platform](https://github.com/pydantic/logfire).

## Interests

I was learning Spanish and French before pivoting to tech, it has been two plus years now but I still listen to Spanish songs on a regular basis. Reading is a big passion of mine and I delve into long reading sessions frequently. I have caught up to `A Song of Ice and Fire` series sometime back -- call me when `The Winds of Winter` arrives, and have just started Sanderson's `A Way of Kings` novel, having fully read the Mistborn series earlier.
I am also playing `Hollow Knight: Silksong` on and off, indulging in the beauty and atmopshere of the game, and raging at the difficulty and challenge at all other occassions.

I’m also into audio-gear – I have `Creative Pebble V3` speakers for my desk setup as they're flexible and connect with bluetooth, and a pair of `Kefine Klean` IEMs for late night music listening and evening walk sessions. Both of these options are great value products and I’m super happy with them, for the time being :P
I currently own an `M1 Macbook Air (16 GB + 256 GB)` that I connect to my Benq 24 inch monitor and write on with the `RK84 V2 keyboard (Brown Switches)`. This is all great but I am tempted to upgrade each of these components eventually in some time (which I won't cause it doesn't make sense -- but I want to!)
