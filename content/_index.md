## About

Bienvenidos to my corner of the internet! I'm Dhruv, a self-taught software engineer mostly interested in backend infrastructures and devops. I started programming in May of 2021 and started working professionally in July 2022. I mainly work with Python, and it is the first language that I learnt. I'd also expored Rust quite a bit, creating some projects and writing about my experiments and observations.

I work as a DevRel Engineer at [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/), an OSS, OpenTelemetry-native observability platform. This is a transition from my previous role as a software engineer, and aligns more with passion for writing.

## Interests

I was learning Spanish and French before pivoting to tech, it has been two plus years now but I still listen to Spanish songs on a regular basis. Reading is a big passion of mine and I delve into long reading sessions frequently. I have caught up to `A Song of Ice and Fire` series sometime back -- call me when `The Winds of Winter` arrives, and have just completed the first three of Sanderson's `Stormlight Archive` series, its a brilliant series but doesn't top the pacing and sense of wonder of Mistborn era 1 IMO.

On the gaming side, I'm pouring a lot of time into Path of Exile, I've probably amassed 5000+ hours into it over Steam and standalone launcher, though I never played it on a good PC until now; the mechanics are the same but it's a totally different world now. Earlier, I was playing `Hollow Knight: Silksong` on and off, indulging in the beauty and atmopshere of the game, and raging at the difficulty and challenge at all other occassions.

I’m also into audio-gear – I have `Creative Pebble V3` speakers for my desk setup as they're flexible and connect with bluetooth, and a pair of `Kefine Klean` IEMs for late night music listening and evening walk sessions. Both of these options are great value products and I’m super happy with them, for the time being :P
I currently own an `M1 Macbook Air (16 GB + 256 GB)` that I connect to my Benq 24 inch monitor and write on with the `RK84 V2 keyboard (Brown Switches)`. This is all great but I am tempted to upgrade each of these components eventually in some time (which I won't cause it doesn't make sense -- but I want to!)
