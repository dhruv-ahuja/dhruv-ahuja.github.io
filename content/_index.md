## Tech

Welcome to my website, my name is Dhruv and I’m a self-taught software engineer mostly interested in backend with a pinch of frontend engineering. I started programming in May of 2021 and started working professionally in July 2022. The first language that I learnt and the one that I work in primarily is Python, though I spent several months just nerding over Rust sometime back, proof of which can found in my blogs and projects. I am also exploring and practicing frontend technologies.

I am currently primarily hacking on [backend_burger](https://github.com/dhruv-ahuja/backend_burger) and learning about scalable backend concepts plus some computer science concepts as well.

## Interests

I was learning Spanish and French before pivoting to tech, it has been two plus years now but I still listen to Spanish songs on a regular basis. Reading is a big passion of mine and I delve into long reading sessions frequently. I have sometime back finished the Witcher and Mistborn (1st generation) series.

I’m also into audio-gear – [Creative Pebble V3](https://en.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble-v3) for the desk and the [Truthear X Crinacle Zero](https://shenzhenaudio.com/products/truthear-zero-earphone-dual-dynamic-drivers-pu-lcp-composite-diaphragm-in-ear-headphone), EQd to Project Red V3, for mostly all other occasions. Both of these options are great value products and I’m super happy with them, for the time being :P
I have also recently upgraded to the RK84 V2 keyboard with Gateron brown switches, a bliss to type on and has helluva battery life.
