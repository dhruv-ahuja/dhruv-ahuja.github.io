# Tech
Welcome to my website, my name is Dhruv and I’m a self-taught software engineer mostly interested in backend with a pinch of frontend engineering. I started programming in May of 2021 and started working professionally in July 2022. The first language that I learnt and the one that I work in primarily is Python, though Rust is quickly taking over my interests and I also like Go, alongside some exposure to frontend technologies like React and tiny bits of Svelte – would certainly like to learn more about frontend moving forward.  
I am currently enjoying working on some pet projects, learning about Rust and furthering my knowledge of computer science and programming on the whole. I would like to get good enough to make some good open-source contributions too, in the near future :)  

# Interests
I was learning Spanish and French before pivoting to tech, it has been two years now but I still listen to Spanish songs on a regular basis. Reading is a big passion of mine and I’m currently reading the Witcher series and also going through [Programming Rust](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/).  
I’m also into audio-gear – [Creative Pebble V3](https://en.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble-v3) for the desk and the [Truthear X Crinacle Zero](https://shenzhenaudio.com/products/truthear-zero-earphone-dual-dynamic-drivers-pu-lcp-composite-diaphragm-in-ear-headphone), EQd to Project Red V3, for mostly all other occasions. Both of these options are great value products and I’m super happy with them, for the time being :P   
I would also like to splurge a bit on a cool mechanical keyboard but my current one works fine except for a few keys, so we wait...
