description = "A CLI tool to download songs, albums and playlists from Spotify with metadata and album cover art. I rewrote the core functionality in Rust for better performance, achieving over 4x speedup for large albums and playlists. The app fetches song information from Spotify and downloads audio from YouTube, then embeds metadata including album art into the downloaded files."
