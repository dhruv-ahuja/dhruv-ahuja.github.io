title = "buffered-queue-rs"
description = "A custom implementation of a simple blocking, buffered queue in Rust. This project was inspired by the 'Programming Rust' book and my desire to better understand concurrency concepts. I learned a lot about mutexes, condition variables, and thread synchronization while building this. The Rust community was incredibly helpful in improving my code and understanding of systems programming concepts."
